Spells on Soul are castable through the magic wand. All elements are listed here:

Weather
Fire
Gravity

To use any of these elements, an essence is required. In the appendix, you will find the recipes to craft these essences. After a right-click on an essence, its element becomes active, and when you hold your magic wand, it will change.

Each element has a Passive, Active, and Ultimate.

All have the same Active with a slight difference in damage, etc.

The Soul Sword, on right-click, has the ability to mark all entities and players within a radius of 40 blocks, making them glow. While sneaking, there is a dash that allows for flying.
